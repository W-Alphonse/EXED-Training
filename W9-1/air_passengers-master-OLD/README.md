Authors: Balazs Kegl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ramp-kits/air_passengers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ramp-kits/air_passengers)

You need to install `ramp-workflow`:

```bash
pip install -U ramp-workflow
```

Then, you will be able to test the starting with the following command:

```bash
ramp-test
```

to test the starting kit submission (`submissions/starting_kit`).

Get started on this RAMP with the [dedicated notebook](air_passengers_starting_kit.ipynb).

You can find more information regarding `ramp-workflow` in the [dedicated documentation](https://paris-saclay-cds.github.io/ramp-docs/ramp-workflow/stable/using_kits.html)
