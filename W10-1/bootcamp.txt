The last two days of the training are dedicated to the Apache Spark Datacamp.  

You will work in teams, trying to provide an effective solution to a given problem related to multi-label classification. 
Given a document collection with labels you must predict the set of labels (tags) that are associated with each "test" document, 
as accurately as possible. 

You should work with the Python programming language for Spark (a.k.a. PySpark). 
All necessary software components and datasets are installed in the cluster
